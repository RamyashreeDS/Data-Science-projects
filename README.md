üöó Stress Test ML Pipeline (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale)

Role: Data Scientist | Apr 2023 ‚Äì Jan 2024
Tech Stack: Python, SQL, Kedro, MLflow, Databricks, Power BI, Random Forest, Logistic Regression

Context:
The European Central Bank (ECB) mandated stress testing to evaluate vehicle residual values under both normal (central) and adverse (stress) economic conditions. The goal was to project risks across 7 European countries and support business decision-making through data-driven insights.

Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented a Kedro-based pipeline to automate data ingestion, preprocessing, and model execution.

Developed Random Forest & Logistic Regression models to estimate residual values under both economic scenarios.

Integrated macroeconomic data with vehicle data for robust forecasting and scenario simulations.

Implemented MLflow for tracking experiments, hyperparameters, and model performance across iterations.

Automated quarterly reporting with Power BI dashboards, ensuring results were consumable by business teams.

Optimized pipeline execution in Databricks, reducing runtime and improving scalability.

Impact:

Enabled quarterly projections for 5 years across 7 countries (UK, Spain, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands).

Improved efficiency of stress test reporting by reducing manual intervention and increasing reproducibility.

Directly supported presentations to the Asset Risk Committee, influencing strategic risk and asset management decisions.
