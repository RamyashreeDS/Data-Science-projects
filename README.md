### 1. 🚗 Stress Test ML Pipeline (Société Générale)  

**Role:** Data Scientist | Apr 2023 – Jan 2024  
**Tech Stack:** Python, SQL, Kedro, MLflow, Databricks, Power BI, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  

**Context:**  
European Central Bank mandated stress testing to evaluate vehicle residual values under normal (central) and adverse (stress) economic conditions. The goal was to project risks across 7 European countries and support decision-making with robust forecasts.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- Built and deployed a **Kedro-based ML pipeline** for data ingestion, preprocessing, and model execution  
- Developed **Random Forest & Logistic Regression models** for central vs. stress scenario predictions  
- Integrated **macroeconomic + vehicle data** for robust scenario analysis  
- Implemented **MLflow** for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and model versioning  
- Automated **quarterly reporting** with Power BI dashboards for business stakeholders  
- Optimized runtime in **Databricks**, improving scalability and efficiency  

**Impact:**  
- Delivered **5-year projections** across 7 countries (UK, Spain, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands)  
- Reduced manual effort in reporting and ensured **reproducibility**  
- Results used in **Asset Risk Committee** meetings to guide asset risk strategy
