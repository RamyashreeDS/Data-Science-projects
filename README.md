### 1. üöó Stress Test ML Pipeline (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale)  

**Role:** Data Scientist | Apr 2023 ‚Äì Jan 2024  
**Tech Stack:** Python, SQL, Kedro, MLflow, Databricks, Power BI, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  

**Context:**  
European Central Bank mandated stress testing to evaluate vehicle residual values under normal (central) and adverse (stress) economic conditions. The goal was to project risks across 7 European countries and support decision-making with robust forecasts.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- Built and deployed a **Kedro-based ML pipeline** for data ingestion, preprocessing, and model execution  
- Developed **Random Forest & Logistic Regression models** for central vs. stress scenario predictions  
- Integrated **macroeconomic + vehicle data** for robust scenario analysis  
- Implemented **MLflow** for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and model versioning  
- Automated **quarterly reporting** with Power BI dashboards for business stakeholders  
- Optimized runtime in **Databricks**, improving scalability and efficiency  

**Impact:**  
- Delivered **5-year projections** across 7 countries (UK, Spain, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands)  
- Reduced manual effort in reporting and ensured **reproducibility**  
- Results used in **Asset Risk Committee** meetings to guide asset risk strategy

### 2. üìä PrevIA Challenger Model (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale)  

**Role:** Data Scientist | Nov 2023 ‚Äì Present  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Kedro, MLflow, Databricks, Power BI, Data Lake, Random Forest, Histogram Gradient Boosting  

**Context:**  
PrevIA was developed as a **challenger ML model** to validate and question residual values proposed by ALD entities. The **Pricing team (ALD SA)** leverages this solution to assess risks and cross-check the legitimacy of residual value estimates provided by different country entities.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- Designed and implemented a **Kedro-based pipeline** to automate ingestion, preprocessing, and modeling  
- Developed and benchmarked ML models (**Random Forest & Histogram Gradient Boosting**) to predict residual values  
- Worked with **Data Lake & Databricks** to handle large-scale, multi-entity datasets efficiently  
- Integrated **MLflow** for tracking experiments, hyperparameters, and model versioning  
- Created **Power BI dashboards** to visualize and communicate differences between predicted vs. proposed values  

**Impact:**  
- Deployed solution across **6 ALD entities** as the initial rollout  
- Enabled the Pricing team to **challenge and validate residual values** across multiple countries  
- Improved risk transparency and strengthened confidence in entity-level pricing strategies
